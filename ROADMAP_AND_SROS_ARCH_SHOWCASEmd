## SROS v2 - Sovereign Depth Roadmap and Architecture Showcase (OSS)

This file is a public-facing, sovereign-depth overview of the SROS v2 architecture, how the planes work, and a roadmap from OSS compiler prompt-spec to an operational kernel-driven system.

### 1) Architecture at a glance
High-level flow:

`CLI Input -> SR7 (Intake) -> SR8 (Compiler) -> SRIR (DAG) -> Orchestrator (Engine) -> Runtime (Tools) -> Mirror (Audit) -> Receipts`  :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Core components (entrypoints, engines, planes, adapters, MCP, prompt registry) are documented in the architecture map. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 2) The four-plane model
SROS v2 is a kernel composed of 4 planes with hard responsibilities:
- ORCH: orchestration engine and lifecycle
- GOV: policy gating, approvals, redaction, snapshots
- MEM: Holocron memory with provenance and contradictions
- MIRROR: identity baseline, drift detection, enforcement :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

These planes interact with ORCH as the driver:
- ORCH requests policy verdicts from GOV
- ORCH reads/writes context via MEM
- ORCH runs drift checks via MIRROR :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### 3) Boot sequence showcase
SROS kernel boots in 8 phases:
INIT -> GOV_BOOT -> MEM_BOOT -> MIRROR_BOOT -> ADAPTERS -> ORCH_BOOT -> VALIDATE -> READY :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

Public value:
- The system does not start executing graphs until it validates its plane dependencies and adapter registry.

### 4) Request lifecycle showcase
Every node executes through a lifecycle that includes:
- preflight hashing
- mirror pre-check
- node-level governance
- memory read
- tool-level governance
- insulation layer
- tool call
- execute
- governance write check
- memory write
- mirror post-check
- receipt emit :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

Public value:
- You can show that governance and identity checks are not optional add-ons. They are in the lifecycle.

### 5) Tooling and MCP showcase
SROS integrates tools through adapters:
- files, http, browser, MCP
Adapters sit behind governance and insulation, and every call can be receipted. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

MCP support exists as a first-class component (server/client/registry) in the architecture map. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

### 6) Data artifacts showcase
SROS writes artifacts to disk for verification and replay, including:
- runs directory (execution artifacts)
- receipts and audit outputs
- protocols and packs storage :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

### 7) Sovereign Depth Roadmap
This roadmap is written for public OSS evolution, not internal-only claims.

#### Phase 0 (Now) - OSS Compiler Prompt-Spec
Deliver:
- SRX ACE v2 agent prompt-spec that outputs:
  - promptunit_package
  - receipts
  - sr8_prompt artifacts
Guarantees:
- no fake scores
- optional hashing placeholders
- URI sanitation
- governance decisions

#### Phase 1 - Validator and Serialization
Deliver:
- CLI validator: checks single-root output, no markdown URIs, no numeric scores
- JSON and YAML serialization modes (same semantics as XML)
- Minimal schema documents published in-repo

Receipt:
- validator run output as a release artifact

#### Phase 2 - SR7 Intake as a real module
Deliver:
- SR7: natural language -> structured intent extraction
- canonical normalization rules
- intent delta and merge

Receipt:
- SR7 normalization receipt emitted per run

#### Phase 3 - SR8 Compiler as an executable library
Deliver:
- SR8: intent -> SRIR GraphSpec compiler
- protocol pack loading
- prompt registry (sr8_prompt templates and variants)

Receipt:
- SR8 compile receipt includes input intent hash, output graph hash (optional until canonical hashing is implemented)

#### Phase 4 - SRIR DAG and ORCH Engine integration
Deliver:
- SRIR DAG format stable
- ORCH executes DAG with checkpoints and receipts
- node lifecycle enforced

Receipt:
- per-node receipts (QC1 style) plus run summary

#### Phase 5 - GOV packs, approvals, redaction, snapshots
Deliver:
- policy packs
- approvals queue
- redaction pipeline
- snapshot rules

Receipt:
- verdict receipts at node and tool stages

#### Phase 6 - MEM Holocron: provenance, contradictions, quarantine
Deliver:
- ingest pipeline with provenance edges
- contradictions detection
- quarantine lane and pinned facts
- retrieval router modes (semantic, fts, hybrid, exact) :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

Receipt:
- ingest receipts and query receipts, each with provenance references

#### Phase 7 - MIRROR: identity baseline, drift enforcement
Deliver:
- identity baseline loader
- drift events and tripwires
- enforcement actions (halt, approve, log) :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

Receipt:
- mirror pre and mirror post receipts per node

#### Phase 8 - Deterministic replay and canonical hashing
Deliver:
- canonical byte serialization of artifacts
- hash chains for receipts
- replay modes (guided and strict) :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

Receipt:
- replay receipt proving identical outputs across runs for the strict subset

### 8) Public architecture demo script (copy-paste)
Use this to demo SROS without over-claiming:

1) Show the flow line: CLI -> SR7 -> SR8 -> SRIR -> ORCH -> Tools -> Mirror -> Receipts
2) Show a boot log: 8 phases to READY
3) Run a tiny graph:
   - ingest a doc to MEM
   - run a governed adapter call
   - emit receipts
4) Open receipts.jsonl and show:
   - GOV verdict
   - adapter selection
   - mirror pre/post
   - final receipt

Everything above maps directly to your architecture docs. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
